# Advent of Code 2018

My solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2018.

I'm using this as an opportunity to refamiliarize myself with [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/). I'm
a little rusty since using it on co-op earlier this year.

I'd also like to check out [coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html),
if possible.
